# MCWD

Calculate MCWD mean basealine or for each year using TRMM precipitation data in .nc4 files and if needed also extract MCWD for GPS point coordinates.
Code for exploratory plots and MCWD Delta or Anomaly is also provided and can be exported as tiff.

All calculations are done using the file 'script.Rmd'. So start there.

TRMM precipitation data (.nc4 files) for South America is available in the folder TRMM and span from 1998-2019.
